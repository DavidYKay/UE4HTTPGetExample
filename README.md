# UE4HTTPGetExample
Minimal example of performing an HTTP GET in Unreal Engine 4.13

Based on this [sample](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/UE4.10_How_To_Make_HTTP_GET_Request_in_C%2B%2B) from the Unreal Engine wiki. 

Please note that this example fetches from a DIFFERENT web service than the PHP-based webservice used in the wiki example.
